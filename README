A ruby library for playing Texas Hold'em poker. Includes hand evaluator.

The goal is to create an online poker application using this library.


Still to-do:
- Betting, raising, all-in, split-pots, etc.

Ideas:
- Add poker nicknames for hole cards (Anna Kournikova for Ace-King, etc.)
- Websockets for server interaction
- Fancy HTML5/CSS3 cards
