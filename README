A ruby library for playing Texas Hold'em poker. Includes hand evaluator.

The goal is to create an online poker application using this library.

Note: Developed using Ruby 1.9, code breaks in 1.8. The card shorthand
notation (7.â™£) is not possible in 1.8.


Still to-do:
- Dealer/blinds
- Betting, raising, all-in, split-pots, etc.
- Remove rigged deck, test by using mocking


Ideas:
- Add poker nicknames for hole cards (Anna Kournikova for Ace-King, etc.)
- Websockets for server interaction
- Fancy HTML5/CSS3 cards

Some rules:
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_(poker)
  "The small blind is placed by the player to the left of the dealer button
   and the big blind is then posted by the player to the left of the person
   sitting in the small blind.
   The one exception to this rule is when there are only 2 players (a
   "heads-up" game). In this case the player on the button is the small blind,
   and the other player is the big blind."
