A ruby library for playing Texas Hold'em poker. Includes hand evaluator.

The goal is to create an online poker application using this library.

Note: Developed using Ruby 1.9, code breaks in 1.8. The card shorthand
notation (7.â™£) is not possible in 1.8.


Still to-do:
- Player positions/dealer/blinds
- Betting, raising, all-in, split-pots, etc.
- Remove rigged deck, test by using mocking


Ideas:
- Add poker nicknames for hole cards (Anna Kournikova for Ace-King, etc.)
- Websockets for server interaction
- Fancy HTML5/CSS3 cards
